Hello reader! Welcome to my professional portfolio where I showcase my knowledge of different technologies, software, and languages that I have learned. Below is a current list of the files I have stored within my portfolio.

SQL Workspace: Contained within the SQL Workspace folder are a few different files containing numerous sample queries of varying degrees of difficulty that I
have written. There will be a seperate README file within this folder containing descriptions of each SQL Workspace file.

Tableau Portfolio Link: This file will include a link to my Tableau portfolio where a couple of different sample visualizations I have created are on display. If you're a baseball fan I highly recommend checking out my MLB Franchise Comparison visualization.
