Hello reader! Welcome to my Github portfolio where I showcase my knowledge of SQL through queries of varying degrees of difficulty. Below will be the description of 
each file that I have located within the SQL Workspace folder. Additionally, I will have a link to my Tableau portfolio should you want to take a look.

Northwind Sample Database Diagram:
    - Many if not all of the queries I have stored in my Github portfolio are based on the popular Northwind sample database which is based on a 
      fictitious food/drink import and export company. This file contains the Entity Relationship Diagram of this database from those who would like to 
      compare the queries side by side with the Northwind ERD.

50 Basic SQL Understanding Queries:
    - These are 50 different beginner practice queries I wrote from a worksheet that I found online. These queries use the Northwind database and consist of 
      various beginner-level SQL maneuvers such as JOINs, aliasing, filtering using non-basic WHERE clauses, and more. This was the first practical example I had
      of writing queries from scratch and connecting to an external database through a hosted server.

Intermediate-Advanced SQL Query Practice:
    - While the 50 basic sql understanding queries file consists solely of pre-written questions found from a worksheet online, each query in this file 
      is written in response to hypothetical questions I came up with regarding the ins and outs of the Northwind business model. Many queries 
      are practical business cases that would likely be included in real-life reports (using LAG and LEAD to compare price changes amongst products) while
      others are more impractical and are simply responses to what-if questions I came up with (ranking product sales by what letter they start with). Each query 
      written was in response to me coming up with prompts that would force me learn new keywords or shortcuts/workarounds. In conclusion, this file showcases my 
      thought-process to solving sample business cases through the use of reasonably complex SQL queries and is a good summarization of my overall SQL skillset.
